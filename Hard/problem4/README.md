# 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays #

[https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)

There are two sorted arrays <b>nums1</b> and <b>nums2</b> of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume <b>nums1</b> and <b>nums2</b> cannot be both empty.

<b>Example 1:</b>
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```
<b>Example 2:</b>
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
